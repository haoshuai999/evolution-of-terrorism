					Suicide bombers targeted three churches and three luxury hotels across Sri Lanka on April 21, 2019. More than 250 people were killed and hundreds other injured, making it the deadliest terror attack in 2019 so far. Numerous other attacks have already taken place in 2019, underscoring the threat terrorism continues to pose towards safety, security and stability across the world.
					<br><br>
					Different forms of terrorism exist, including state-sponsored, political and religious terrorism. Methods and tactics of terror groups have evolved over the years. To understand in what ways the transformation has taken place, we looked at the Global Terrorism Database (GTD).
					<br><br>
					Before we dive into the analysis, it is important to know how GTD defines terrorism:
					“the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation.”

						<h3>1970s</h3>
						<p>Major attacks during this period include the bombing of SwissAir flight 330 by Palestinian extremists, along with several attacks carried out by the Irish Republican Army.
						<br><br>
						This was also the decade when narco terrorism and left-wing extremism gained more prominence in Colombia, claiming hundreds of lives. 
						<br><br>
						The ‘Dirty War’ in Argentina and ‘Years of Lead’ in Italy resulted in hundreds of attacks. Euskadi Ta Askatasuna(ETA) carried out multiple attacks in Spain during this time period.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class='step' data-step='2'>
						<h3>1980s</h3>
						<p>Right wing narco-terrorists and left-wing revolutionary guerrilla fighters inflicted a large number of attacks in nations like Colombia and Peru during this time period. Attacks by IRA and ETA continued in the United Kingdom and Spain respectively.
						<br><br>
						Multiple instances of state-sponsored terrorism occurred in El Salvador during this period. Pro-Khalistan extremists carried out multiple attacks in Punjab (India). Various Middle Eastern factions carried out shootings and bombings in France, mainly in Paris.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class='step' data-step='3'>
						<h3>1990s</h3>
						<p>TNationalist extremists from the Basque, Breton and Corsican communities carried out a number of assassinations and targeted bomb attacks in France in the 1990s. Islamic militancy gained prominence in India, which led to a spate of attacks in Kashmir.
						<br><br>
						Number of attacks in Colombia escalated sharply during this period as FARC gained more influence. Islamic terrorists carried out a number of attacks in Philippines in the 1990s. More than 500 attacks were reported from West Bank and Gaza in this decade.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class='step' data-step='4'>
						<h3>2000s</h3>
						<p>With 9/11 attacks, focus of terrorism shifted squarely to Afghanistan. Colombia continued to reel under extremist attacks, with more than 1000 attacks reported on its soil. 
						<br><br>
						Number of terror attacks rose sharply in India, the most infamous being the attack on Mumbai in 2008.
						<br><br>
						Terror-related incidents shot up in Iraq, after US-led forces captured the country and displaced Saddam Hussein. The South Thailand insurgency also flared up and became more violent during this decade.
						</p>

						<h3>50 Deadliest Attacks since 1970</h3>
						<p>Major civil wars and communist revolutions erupted in the late 1970s leading to a large number of fatalities in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Both state-sponsored terrorism and left-wing guerilla attacks were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people during the crisis.

						The Central American Crisis bore out of the repression of the labor and peasant class, which had forced them into harsh living conditions.</p>

						<h3>Rwandan Genocide</h3>
						<p>A 100-day killing spree by ethnic Hutu extremists resulted in the deaths of 800,000 Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994. Tutsis belonged to the minority community. The massacre started after the Hutus accused the Tutsi exile group Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) of assassinating the Rwandan president.
						<br><br>
						Lists of government opponents were handed out to militias who went and killed them, along with all of their families. Neighbours killed neighbours and some husbands even killed their Tutsi wives, saying they would be killed if they refused.

						<h3>September 11th Attacks</h3>
						<p>On September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda carried out the biggest terrorist attack on the US soil. The attacks killed around 3000 people and injured over 6000. Four passenger aircraft were hijacked by 19 Al-Qaeda terrorists. Two of those planes crashed into the World Trade Towers in New York, leading to massive loss of life and property. The third plane crashed into the Pentagon. The fourth plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania, after passengers thwarted the hijackers’ plan to fly the plane to Washington D.C.</p>

						<h3>Evolution of Target Type</h3>
						<p>This step 12 was made to increase the amount of funding received from the European Union, which dedicates a third of its budget (50 billion euros) to less economically developed regions for investments in infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals. Yet when regions improve economically, they no longer qualify for the same amount of funding. As a type of statistical gerrymandering, governors of these regions—like in Hungary—have redrawn their borders in order to keep the money flowing.</p>
