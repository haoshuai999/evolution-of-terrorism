# Evolution of Terrorism

The data visualization work can be seen at https://haoshuai999.github.io/

This is a webpage about the evolution of terrorism from 1970 to 2017. We used JavaScript library jQuery, D3.js and scrollama.js to visualize the terrorism attacks data from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). Iteractive map is used to shown the number of attacks in each country by decade. Bubble chart is used to show fifty deadlest attacks and line charts are used to show the changes of attack weapons and attack targets.

The clock folder shows a creative clock I designed, which is irrelevant with the data visualzation work.
